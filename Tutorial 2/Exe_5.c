/*
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers in which each term is the sum of the
two preceding terms: Un = Un−1 + Un−2. It begins with the two terms 0 and 1. Thus, the
first 7 terms of this sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
• Write the iterative procedure that computes the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
• Write the recursive version of the same procedure.
The result is returned in one of the parameters of the procedure.
